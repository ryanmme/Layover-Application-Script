# Layover-Application-Script

## For NYC - ZRH(Zurich) - Xiamen

Dear Swiss Airlines,


Hi! This is a foreign student in U.S. and I’m writing to consult if a certain route of your flights has been approved by Singapore for layover at their Changi Airport. 


The route that many of us eagerly consider about is operating as following: New York (JFK) - Zurich (ZRH) - Singapore (SIN) - Xiamen, China (XMN). And the respective flights are: LX 15 (departing on Monday) - LX 176 (on Tue) - MF852 (on Wed, by Xiamen Airlines). 


As what we learned from Changi Airport who just opened up for international layover, that due to public health concerns, they are requiring the ‘initial carriers’ to submit the entire route to their agency for application. They would NOT allow any layover until the specific route was permitted, and the boarding passes for the entire route are printed out at the very beginning spot. 


I’m writing as many of my friends share the same desire here. We’re students from China and we just finished our study in U.S., preparing to return. Due to health concerns, the airlines’ flights from SIN to China have significantly shrunk. Most of us have bought the ticket of MF852 from Singapore to Xiamen (China) which departs only on every Wednesday. 


We haven’t decided to buy the flights operated by Swiss Airlines to carry us from U.S. to Singapore because the Changi Airport replied that this route was not in their approved list yet.


We are expecting that this route’s application can be submitted and approved. 


Would you mind sharing with us what step is it now and keeping the updates? Is the route application submitted? If so, we’ll contact the Changi airport and provide more details for their consideration. I'd sincerely appreciate your kind helps. 


Thank you and wish you a great day!
